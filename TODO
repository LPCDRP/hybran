* Have RATT output valid EMBL files for its annotation (the current release has issues with this)

* Parse RATT's output for non-syntenic regions

* Find ab initio annotations corresponding to the positions where annotation was not transferred

* Combine the annotations files
   - Need a way to handle feature overlaps
