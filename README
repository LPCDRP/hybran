# Design

Given non-syntenic positions from RATT, find the annotations in those positions determined using an ab initio annotation.

## Disadvantages

RATT uses Nucmer and with parameter sets that have to be played around with.
Nucmer's alignments can be suboptimal and cause the comparison to miss some things.
